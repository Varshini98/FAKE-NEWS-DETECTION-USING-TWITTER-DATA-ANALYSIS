# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION-USING-TWITTER-DATA-ANALYSIS

A classification model that can be used as a fake news detector by identifying characteristics in news and embedding the model in a Python application that can be used to locate bogus news data.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The technique is based on the application of a number of machine learning algorithms to datasets, including, logistic regression, random forest, and decision trees. Experiments are carried out on each algorithm and accuracy is calculated.
